# A goofy snowman app

I created this OpenGL-based application during my college (undergrad) course on computer graphics. It's implemented badly. It doesn't use vertex arrays. I didn't know what I was doing in creating the viewport. It's all a mess. But for some reason, I still have it on my hard drive more than twenty years later, so here it is in all its glory.

Controls:\
Up/Down - Zoom in/out\
Left/Right - Rotate camera\
Mouse - Control the direction the snowman is facing. (No need to click.)\
Q - Quit\
Space bar - Jump\
S - Enter single-step animation mode\
R - Resume animated mode\
F - Toggle GL fog\
